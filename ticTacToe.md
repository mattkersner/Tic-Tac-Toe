# TIC TAC TOE
--------
Your mission, is to build Tic Tac Toe from **Scratch**!</br>
Yup, you read it right.</br>

Over the next three days, you will plan, pseudo code, and implement your first game. You can either do this **solo** or through **pair programming with one other person**</br>

_To guide your way_ </br>
This is an excellent opportunity to plan and breakdown a problem first on paper, to understand its components before tackling the code.

Things to think about: </br>
- What is Tic Tac Toe? How is it played?
- What does it look like?
- How can you represent this programmatically?
- How can you use pseudocode to break down the functionality to the smallest piece.

Remember, to logic through to the very end before typing a line of code! </br>

Also, think about all the tool we've used so far:</br>
- `strings`
- `numbers`
- `arrays`
- `objects`
- `functions`
- `booleans`
- `control flow structures`
- `DOM`

Which of these tools you are going to need to build this game? </br>
What are the pros/cons of each of these tools? </br>

**Submission**</br>
This homework is DUE on THURSDAY at 10PM. Please, use the time we are so generously giving you to complete all the previous assignments you fell behind on!

Again, you can choose to work alone or with a partner (no more than one)!

Just as always, submit a link to your homework as an issue. If you worked with a partner, submit only **ONE** issue mentioning **both** of your names and links to **both** repositories.
